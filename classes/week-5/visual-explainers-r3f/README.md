# ITP Visual Journalism Fall 2023 - Intro to React Three Fiber

In this section we will introduce React Three Fiber, Drei and three.js and go over some basic 3D concepts. We will conclude by building out a simple 3D scene on a scrolly with a couple of primitive shapes that animates and some HTML slides positioned along the scroll.

## What is React Three Fiber?

React-three-fiber is a React renderer for three.js. Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can participate in React's ecosystem.

## Things to try next...

- Try adding your own component which encapsulates a primitive 3D shape and animates someway in the animation loop
- Try tweaking the RotateChildren component to introduce new group level behaviors to the entire scene
- Try styling the slides and adding links/media in them to customize the HTML story elements
