# ITP Visual Journalism Fall 2023 - Intro to React

In this section we will introduce React and a few React concepts. This will be a quick and shallow introduction, as the focus will be using React with React Three Fiber for 3D visualization - but further reads will be provided for additional React materials.

## What is React?

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.

## Things to try next...

- Make your own form submitting component with a user name and an email using state, refs and event functions (extra points: think about componentizing it in a way that'd be resuable in the future if we need to use it elsewhere)
  - Submitting should trigger an `alert()` with the name and email (pst, you can use the special quotes to template and concat the variables with a string - see `src/MyEffectComponent.jsx` from an example)
- Try adding styles to `div`s inline to make them look better ðŸ˜‰
